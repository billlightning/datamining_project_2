## Movielens Dataset -Rule and Cluster Based Recommender
Recommender system of group "robophobes". Our model for Movielens dataset aims to create a recommender system through association rules discovery for item-item recommendations and K-Means clustering for user segmentation.

## Requirements to Reproduce
1. Python with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn libraries installed.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the first.ipynb:** This notebook contains all the functions. Running it will start the processes.
3. **Results:** After running the scripts, you'll see visualizations and outputs.

## File Descriptions
-`First.ipynb`: Python script containing the fuctions to conduct the experiment.
- `ratings.csv` , `links.csv` , `tags.csv` , `movies.csv` : Datasets needed for system.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the datasets in the same directory as the scripts.
