## Titanic Dataset -Classification
Titanic dataset classification of group "robophobes". Our model for Titanic dataset aims to shape the data through data preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection.

## Requirements to Reproduce
1. Python with numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, missingno libraries installed.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the DM_Project_1.ipynb:** This notebook contains all the functions. Running it will start the processes.
3. **Results:** After running the scripts, you'll see visualizations and outputs.

## File Descriptions
-`DM_Project_1.ipynb`: Python script containing the fuctions to conduct the experiment.
- `train.csv`: Titanic dataset used for training the model.
- `test.csv`: Titanic dataset used for testing the model.
- `robophobestitanic.csv`: Processed Titanic dataset saved after preprocessing.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets in the same directory as the scripts.
